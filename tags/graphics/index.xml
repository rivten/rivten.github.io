Throughout the course, we studied in-class and by ourselves several articles spanning lots of sub-topics of 3D graphics.
I have compiled that list here. Note that this list is by no means exhaustive, might not span the full knowledge (or even possible the basic knowledge) of a specific subtopic and might be lacking very important reference.</description></item><item><title>TL;DR of the paper 'High-Performance Procedural Noise using a Histogram-Preserving Blending Operator'</title><link>https://rivten.github.io/posts/2018-07-07-tldr-noise-histogram/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivten.github.io/posts/2018-07-07-tldr-noise-histogram/</guid><description>Inspired by the work of Eric Arneb√§ck, I wanted to try my own TLDR of graphics acamedic papers. In here, I want to describe the work of Eric Heitz and Fabrice Neyet in the paper High-Performance Procedural Noise using a Histogram-Preserving Blending Operator. Please note that the images are directly taken from the paper and are not mine.
The problem Let&amp;rsquo;s say an artist made a texture for the ground in your game, but he only did a small patch of the ground and you want to have the pattern repeat on a ground that is way larger than what the artist drew.</description></item></channel></rss>
