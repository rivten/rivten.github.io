Throughout the course, we studied in-class and by ourselves several articles spanning lots of sub-topics of 3D graphics.
I have compiled that list here. Note that this list is by no means exhaustive, might not span the full knowledge (or even possible the basic knowledge) of a specific subtopic and might be lacking very important reference.</description></item><item><title>Article Study : Surface Simplification using Quadric Error Metrics</title><link>https://rivten.github.io/posts/2016-11-05-surface_simplification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivten.github.io/posts/2016-11-05-surface_simplification/</guid><description>An article study series ? Lately, I have been reading a lot of scientific papers about various topics : computer graphics, physics or mesh processing. I found that it is very interesting to have an insight about a particular field and understand what is at stake and where the current research efforts are today.
It struck me that I could do this while watching Casey Muratori&amp;rsquo;s video on Papers we Love.</description></item></channel></rss>
