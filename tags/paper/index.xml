Throughout the course, we studied in-class and by ourselves several articles spanning lots of sub-topics of 3D graphics.
I have compiled that list here. Note that this list is by no means exhaustive, might not span the full knowledge (or even possible the basic knowledge) of a specific subtopic and might be lacking very important reference.</description></item></channel></rss>
