Welcome to *The Road to a Protoype*, a blog series in which I weekly describe my attempt at prototyping a small game all by myself.

# Previously in...

Well it's been a long time. I took some time off the prototyping project but now I am back to it more than ever.
Last time, I talked about the event system which was very basic and can certainly be improved. But I chose for this week a very different topic and I decided to go with inventory.

# Going wild at first

It is sometimes hard to see what is the next most fundamental feature your prototype lacks because there's ton of it missing, where to go next ? Inventory is the next step to have a wilder range of resource type, moreover resources are fundamental to the gameplay in my case, so it was important for the player to have the tools to interact with them. So I went on with the inventory prototype.

Looking back at my week of programming, I think I could have pick something even easier for the inventory system, which just displays the list of items you have -- isn't it what the inventory is after all ? I decided that my first iteration of the inventory would be a basic screen with the following constraints :

1. A basic screen that appears when the user press I (for **I**nventory)
2. The inventory screen is split in three subscreen.
  1. A subscreen showing what item the character wears in which part of his body.
  2. A subscreen showing the basic characteristics of the player, like health, strength, and so on.
  3. A subscreem showing all the inventory slots and what's in all of them.
3. You can select items from the slots and drag-and-drop them into the first subscreen to make the character wear a particular item.

This is very basic but I think the biggest problem it raises is that it assumes too much about the gameplay of the game, like the fact that there probably be basic RPG characterics while this is not decided yet. But I noticed that only later in the development of this feature. On the other hand, I did not spend a huge amount of time implementing all this, and most of the work done here can be reused if the inventory design is to be reworked.

# Keyboard input

Receiving keyboard input from the user was not supported before, and I wanted to get it right. Basically, I expect two things from the input system :
1. To tell me if a key is down at this frame.
2. To tell me if a key was down in the previous frame.

I must therefore have two sets of input, one for the current and one from the previous frame. Each frame you get the keyboard state and at the end of the frame you pass the data around in order for the data to be consistent.

# Drawing rects within rects within rects within...

Now let's render a basic inventory screen. I chose a basic size for the inventory background screen, this background rectangle is in window coordinate. One unit will end up being one pixel on the screen.

But, since I want to have subscreens, it might not be very convenient to have all those be in window coordinate because a simple change in the background will affect all the following rectangles in the hierarchy. What I would rather have, is *relative* coordinates. You place each subscreen within a parent screen. And you only convert when you are about to draw the child rect. For example, I want my first subscreen to take all the left part of the inventory screen, therefore its relative rect will be from (x, y) = (0, 0) to (x, y) = (0.5, 1).

After that, I only need a very small routine that converts a relative-coordinates rect to an absolute-coordinates one.

{% highlight c++ %}
rect2 ToParentRect(rect2 Child, rect2 Parent)
{
	rect2 Result = {};

	v2 ParentSize = RectSize(Parent);
	v2 ChildSize = RectSize(Child);

	Result.Min = Parent.Min + Hadamard(ParentSize, Child.Min);
	Result.Max = Result.Min + Hadamard(ParentSize, ChildSize);

	return(Result);
}
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it. I can render as many level of hierarchy as I like. One thing that could be improved in this system is to explicit the hierarchy data which is hardcoded at the moment.

Then, this is how it looks like when the inventory is enable.

# Putting stuff in the bag

Then it was only a matter of the player having a real inventory. As always, for now, only basic stuff, so the player only have six item slots which are filled with only weapons and books at the moment. Weapon are in red, books in blue. This was pretty easy to setup and to render thanks to the absolute-relative convertion system I presented.

One challenge that have however appeared is the game data storage. At the moment, all game data (such as weapon names, hit points, ...) are statically stored in the code, hardcoded. This is not at all what we want and this will be taken care of when dealing with a more powerful data system.

Other than that, the data structure went only a little bit more furnished but nothing very fancy happened, just regular *writing the usage code first*.

To prove that my system was easily extendable, I added a small fancy feature, which is having an hint appear when you pass your mouse over an item in the inventory.

# Where to go from there ?

If I wanted, I could spend another week on the inventory system as the system I have on my hands right now is not even fully functionnal. I have to think about that because it might be premature to engage so much in a feature I am not that sure about.

Another path I could take would be, as stated in a previous post, to make maps bigger. At some points, I would also need to stop coding and think deeply about the design because there are huge holes over there which hinder me from going forward in some part of the code.

But for now, let's get to programming.
