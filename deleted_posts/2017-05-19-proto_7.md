Welcome to *The Road to a Protoype*, a blog series in which I weekly describe my attempt at prototyping a small game all by myself.

# Previously in...

Last week was a special episode since I talked (and ranted) about a feature that did not end up (yet !) in the current prototype. The week before that, I worked on a new version of the renderer and this is this very new version that allowed me to take the big steps that I took this week.

# The idea of hexagonal tile map

I do not exactly know why but I have always had this fascination around hexagonal tile maps. They do no form a pattern as pleasing as square tiles but they are very regular. It is as if I could not completely understand them, as if they had this magic aura around them.

For a few weeks, I felt that I was kind of stuck around ideas about where to go next for the prototype. Everything seemed either too hard, too early to do or inappropriate. I was not even fuly happy about the current state of the prototype as it stood; but a few days ago, the idea to replace the current map with a regular hex tile map struck me, and I really liked it. I always thought that having a hex tile system was hard, not impossible to overcome of course, but not a tricky task. It turns out I was wrong and replacing the previous map system was fairly easy and pleasing.

# Properties of hex tile map

Hex tile maps are often seen in some boards games, role-playing games and strategy games (such as the Civ series). They are mostly used for characters movement instead of square tile maps for a very specific reason. This reason is a very important property of hex tile map which is the following :

> On a hex tile map, the distance between a tile and *all* its neighbors is the same.

This is not true on a square tile map. Indeed, on a square tile map, if the distance between a tile and its left neighbor is 1, then the distance between a tile and its top-left neighbor is $\sqrt{2}$.

This is why hex tile maps are used where characters movement and distance is an important part of the gameplay.

# Implementing hex tile map

Where to start from ? Well, from learning about hex tiles of course. There is several things to learn about hex tile map before implementing them. The challenges are :

1. geometry and rendering of an individual hex tile
2. hex tile map storage
3. hex tile map coordinate system
3. basic hex tile map operations such as : neighbor finding, pathfinding, distance computing

Fortunately, I found a *very* useful reference on [this website](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) that helped me go through all the points above. I am not going to re-explain all the points that are already very carefully layed out in the article so, if you are interested, you should definitively check it out.

### Geometry

Rendering an hex tile was a very easy task with the integrated renderer I developed and once the basic geometric properties of an hexagon were understood. Rendering an hex tile is just drawing 6 lines on the screen.

{% highlight c++ %}
void SDLDrawHexagon(SDL_Renderer* Renderer,
        v2 Center, float Radius, v4 Color, float InitialAngle = 0)
{
	float AngularStep = 2.0f * PI / 6.0f;
	SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(Renderer, 255 * Color.r, 255 * Color.g, 
                                   	 255 * Color.b, 255 * Color.a);
	for(u32 Index = 0; Index < 6; ++Index)
	{
		float AngleBegin = InitialAngle + AngularStep * Index;
		float AngleEnd   = InitialAngle + AngularStep * (Index + 1);

		u32 BeginX = Center.x + Radius * Cos(AngleBegin);
		u32 BeginY = Center.y + Radius * Sin(AngleBegin);

		u32 EndX = Center.x + Radius * Cos(AngleEnd);
		u32 EndY = Center.y + Radius * Sin(AngleEnd);

		SDL_RenderDrawLine(Renderer, BeginX, BeginY, EndX, EndY);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, to integrate it within the renderer system, it was just a matter of adding a new command type in the rendering system that you could push into the rendering command buffer with a simple PushHex() command.

### Tile map storage and coordinate system

For the coordinate system, I used, as recommended in the previously linked article, the *axial coordinate system* which is explained [here](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-axial).

Therefore, a hex tile is a very simple struct containing its axial coordinates and other simple parameters. I also need a struct to store the basic property of the tile map, such as its origin, the radius of a single tile, and each unit vector in the axial system.

{% highlight c++ %}
struct hex_tile
{
	u32 q;
	u32 r;

	// NOTE(hugo) : The following parameters are for the gameplay
	site Site;
	bool TextValidated;
	bool Discovered;
};

struct hex_tile_map_data
{
	v2 Origin;
	float Radius;
	v2 QUnit;
	v2 RUnit;
};
{% endhighlight %}

I did not do something particularly smart for the storing system: I just allocated a large amount of hex tiles upfront and we will see in the future how it goes. I cannot predict as of yet how big the map will be and how many tiles I will need so it is way too early to design a complex system when we do not exactly know the constraints it needs to fullfill.

That is why I just have a big array of tiles that I iterate upon every time and, as for the current state of the prototype, I did not hit any performance issues yet, I will deal with those when I will have a clearer idea of how the system will behave.

For example, here is how I render the hex tile map, I just iterate over all the tiles

{% highlight c++ %}
float HexRadius = GameState->TileMapData.Radius;
v2 QUnit = GameState->TileMapData.QUnit;
v2 RUnit = GameState->TileMapData.RUnit;
for(u32 TileIndex = 0; TileIndex < GameState->TileCount; ++TileIndex)
{
	hex_tile* Tile = GameState->TileMap + TileIndex;
	v2 TilePos = HexTilePos(*Tile, GameState->TileMapData);

	PushHex(Renderer, TilePos, GameState->TileMapData.Radius, MarkerColor);

	// NOTE(hugo) : Below are more gameplay-related rendering
	// [...]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Dead simple. Effective now. Allow me to iterate quickly. I use the exact same approach for other operations as well: when I want to see in which tile I clicked, I just iterate over all the tiles until I found the one I clicked in.

### Neighbors finding and tile clicking

There was two last operations I needed to impletent to get back to a state that was very close to the previous system (when I used a graph for the map): checking if two tiles were neighbors and, given a position, checking if that position was within a specific tile.

For the *is_inside* operation, I, once again, went for the trivial, approximate approach. The exact approach would have required the following algorithm :
* split the hex tile in six triangles
* for each triangle, check if the position is inside the triangle, if it is, stop there and return true, if not continue
* if no triangle were find, return false

I am not claiming this is very hard to implement, but I could reach a good estimate solution with an even simpler method and that was what I aimed for. I just, with pen and paper, found out the radius of the inner circle of an hex tile (pretty easy to do with basic trigonometry) and check if the position was inside that circle.

{% highlight c++ %}
bool InsideHex(v2 P, hex_tile* Tile, hex_tile_map_data TileMapData)
{
	v2 QUnit = TileMapData.QUnit;
	v2 RUnit = TileMapData.RUnit;
	v2 TilePos = HexTilePos(*Tile, TileMapData);

	float SmallerCircleRadius = TileMapData.Radius * Cos(PI / 6.0f);
	float SmallerCircleRadiusSqr = SmallerCircleRadius * SmallerCircleRadius;
	bool Result = (LengthSqr(P - TilePos) < SmallerCircleRadiusSqr);

	return(Result);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The result is approximate but unnoticeable for now and sufficient. I will have a lot of time in the future to improve this.

Finally, checking if two tiles are neighbors is a trivial task once you understand the axial coordinate system. You just need to list all the possibilities for the coordinate delta and see if that delta is within all those possibilities.

{% highlight c++ %}
bool AreHexTileNeighbors(hex_tile* A, hex_tile* B)
{
	s32 dQ = A->q - B->q;
	s32 dR = A->r - B->r;
	bool Result = (dQ == -1 && (dR ==  0 || dR == 1) ||
                       dQ ==  0 && (dR == -1 || dR == 1) ||
                       dQ ==  1 && (dR == -1 || dR == 0));

	return(Result);
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Conclusion

Now here is how it looks like in-game for now :

<center>Hex tile map</center>

The player can move between adjacent tile and the whole event system was updated to work with the tile system. The only part of the world system that was not translated into hex tiles was the zones as it requires to define borders and to draw those borders which is slightly harder than the rest. This is still an interesting problem that I am likely to tackle soon but there are lots of stuff to work on still.

Let's get to programming.
