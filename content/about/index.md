Hello ! My name is hugo.

I am a 30 year-old programmer interested in coding from high to low-level and writing fiction.

I _love_ learning languages, from assembly to Rust, C, Zig, Clojure, OCaml, Haskell or even BQN.
I have worked in the video game industry as well as in webdev. I am always learning about other subjects, for instance multithreading, rendering or low-level programming.

I love complex technical challenges as much as creative endeavours.
