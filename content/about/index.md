Hello ! My name is Hugo.

I am a 30 year-old programmer interested in video game-development and related topics.

I mostly focus on programming in C and C++, using as little libraries as possible.
Right now, I am working as gameplay-engine programmer at Ubisoft but I am always learning about other subjects, for instance multithreading, rendering or low-level programming.

I love complex technical challenges as much as creative endeavours.

On this blog you can learn more about projects I am currently working on, and articles I liked.
I enjoy watching [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org).
You can find my (old) resume [here](hugo_viala_resume.pdf).
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
