Welcome to *The Road to a Protoype*, a blog series in which I weekly describe my attempt at prototyping a small game all by myself.

# Previously in...

Last week, I implemented a small camera system to be able to see the world map from very close or very far away. This was very valuable to see lots of parts of the map at once. As it was finally time to fill the map with actual content, it seemed that one final thing was missing : bitmap rendering.

# Bitmap rendering

What I wanted for the map was pretty simple at first : I wanted them to have different types, such as forest, desert, mountain. Basic stuff. Until now, the only way I had to display that information was by drawing a thin circle inside the hex tile which is not very helpful. Therefore I had two options : either fill hex tiles myself or creating a hex tile bitmap to render.

The first option meant being able to fill triangles (since a hex tile is the union of six equilateral triangles) which is not very easy to do given basic SDL tools[^1]. Besides, I would have had to do bitmap rendering at some point : indeed either the tiles or the player will have to switch to using bitmap eventually. So why not start right now ?

I began by creating several hex bitmaps filled with a specific color in Gimp, in a very simple fashion just to have something to work with.

# Bitmap loading

For loading the bitmap to main memory, I could either do it all by myself, the Handmade Hero way or I could use a library. I am very fond of the [stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb) that are very simple, lightweighted and straightforward to use. Therefore, the code for loading a bitmap to memory is also pretty straightforward :

{% highlight c++ %}
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_image.h"
struct bitmap
{
	u32 Width;
	u32 Height;
	void* Data;

	// NOTE(hugo) : Offset is in percent relative to the bitmap size
	v2 Offset;
	bool IsValid;
};

bitmap LoadBitmap(char* Filename, v2 Offset = V2(0.0f, 0.0f))
{
	bitmap Result = {};
	s32 Depth = 0;
	s32 Width = 0;
	s32 Height = 0;
	Result.Data = stbi_load(Filename, &Width, &Height, &Depth, 4);
	Assert(Result.Data);

	Result.Width = SafeCastToU32(Width);
	Result.Height = SafeCastToU32(Height);
	Assert(Result.Width > 0);
	Assert(Result.Height > 0);
	Result.Offset = Offset;
	Result.IsValid = true;

	return(Result);
}

void FreeBitmap(bitmap Bitmap)
{
	stbi_image_free(Bitmap.Data);
}
{% endhighlight %}

And that is basically it. I just need to add all the bitmap to the game_state structure and load them at init time. I still want to highlight the fact that, because of the stb_image library, my compile time went from 0.3 seconds to 0.9 seconds. This is still not that much but noticeable for *just* an image loading library.

# Bitmap rendering

Rendering a bitmap is fairly easy now that the rendering API is layed out. Here are the basic steps done :

1. Add a new render_command_type : RenderCommand_Bitmap
2. Add a new render_command struct for bitmaps : this contains the position to draw the bitmap and the bitmap itself
3. Provides a way to the user to push a bitmap rendering command onto the renderer's command buffer : 

{% highlight c++ %}
void PushBitmap(renderer* Renderer, bitmap Bitmap, v2 P)
{
	render_command Command = {};
	Command.Type = RenderCommand_Bitmap;
	Command.Pos = P;
	Command.Bitmap = Bitmap;

	if(Renderer->Mode == RenderMode_UI)
	{
		AddFlags(&Command, RenderCommandFlag_UI);
	}

	PushCommand(Renderer, Command);
}
{% endhighlight %}

4. Render given a bitmap rendering command :

{% highlight c++ %}
case RenderCommand_Bitmap:
	{
		Assert(Command->Bitmap.IsValid);

		v2 BitmapSize = Renderer->PixelsToMeters * V2(Command->Bitmap.Width, 
			Command->Bitmap.Height);
		v2 OffsetP = Hadamard(Command->Bitmap.Offset, BitmapSize);
		rect2 DestRect = RectFromMinSize(Command->Pos - OffsetP, BitmapSize);

		if(!FlagSet(Command->Flags, RenderCommandFlag_UI))
		{
			DestRect = Projection(Renderer, DestRect);
		}

		u32 RedMask   = 0x000000FF;
		u32 GreenMask = 0x0000FF00;
		u32 BlueMask  = 0x00FF0000;
		u32 AlphaMask = 0xFF000000;

		u32 Depth = 32;
		u32 Pitch = 4 * Command->Bitmap.Width;

		// NOTE(hugo) : The bitmap is not in the cache. Add it
		SDL_Surface* BitmapSurface = SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceFrom(Command->Bitmap.Data,
				Command->Bitmap.Width, Command->Bitmap.Height, Depth, Pitch,
				RedMask, GreenMask, BlueMask, AlphaMask);
		Assert(BitmapSurface);

		BitmapTexture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(Renderer->SDLContext,
				BitmapSurface);
		SDL_FreeSurface(BitmapSurface);
		Assert(BitmapTexture);

		SDL_Rect SDLDestRect = SDLRect(DestRect);
		SDLDestRect.y = Renderer->WindowSizeInPixels.y - SDLDestRect.y;

		SDL_RenderCopy(Renderer->SDLContext, BitmapTexture,
				0, &SDLDestRect);
		SDL_DestroyTexture(BitmapTexture);

	} break;
{% endhighlight %}

Basically, what this does is that it creates a SDL_Surface and a SDL_Texture from the bitmap data and render it on the screen.

Here is the result on the whole tile map.

# Small optimization : data caching

The result looked OK but the performance was horrible. I run a profiler -- I used Valgrind which is not perfect but does the job -- to see what was causing the bad performance. I assumed it was the repeatitive creation of SDL_Surface and SDL_Texture but I wanted to be sure of it. This was indeed the issue : for each tile, I was computing the texture for it, *so if there was 100 mountain tiles, I would compute the mountain texture a hundred times*.

I decided to go for something pretty simple to fix this issue : caching the most recently used SDL_Texture in the renderer; meaning that I would keep in memory a certain amount of recently displayed textures to avoid recomputing the SDL_Texture several times each frame. The rendering cache would contain the already computed textures as well as the data they point to in order to recognize them[^2].

{% highlight c++ %}
struct renderer
{
	// NOTE(hugo) : Other parameters
	//  [...]

	// NOTE(hugo) : Caching to avoid 
	// over computation of SDL_Texture
	void* CachedData[16];
	SDL_Texture* CachedTextures[16];
	u32 CacheCount;
};
{% endhighlight %}

Now, *writing the usage code first*, I changed the rendering bitmap code as well,

{% highlight c++ %}
case RenderCommand_Bitmap:
	{
		Assert(Command->Bitmap.IsValid);

		v2 BitmapSize = Renderer->PixelsToMeters * V2(Command->Bitmap.Width, 
			Command->Bitmap.Height);
		v2 OffsetP = Hadamard(Command->Bitmap.Offset, BitmapSize);
		rect2 DestRect = RectFromMinSize(Command->Pos - OffsetP, BitmapSize);

		if(!FlagSet(Command->Flags, RenderCommandFlag_UI))
		{
			DestRect = Projection(Renderer, DestRect);
		}

		u32 RedMask   = 0x000000FF;
		u32 GreenMask = 0x0000FF00;
		u32 BlueMask  = 0x00FF0000;
		u32 AlphaMask = 0xFF000000;

		u32 Depth = 32;
		u32 Pitch = 4 * Command->Bitmap.Width;

		SDL_Texture* BitmapTexture = FindTextureInCache(Renderer, Command->Bitmap.Data);
		if(!BitmapTexture)
		{
			// NOTE(hugo) : The bitmap is not in the cache. Add it
			SDL_Surface* BitmapSurface = 
			        SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceFrom(Command->Bitmap.Data,
					Command->Bitmap.Width, Command->Bitmap.Height, 
					Depth, Pitch,
					RedMask, GreenMask, BlueMask, AlphaMask);
			Assert(BitmapSurface);

			BitmapTexture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(Renderer->SDLContext,
					BitmapSurface);
			SDL_FreeSurface(BitmapSurface);
			Assert(BitmapTexture);

			PushRenderCache(Renderer, BitmapTexture, Command->Bitmap.Data);
		}

		SDL_Rect SDLDestRect = SDLRect(DestRect);
		SDLDestRect.y = Renderer->WindowSizeInPixels.y - SDLDestRect.y;

		SDL_RenderCopy(Renderer->SDLContext, BitmapTexture,
				0, &SDLDestRect);

	} break;
{% endhighlight %}

Note that now, we first try to find a texture in the rendering texture cache before computing it. The FindTextureInCache call is very simple :

{% highlight c++ %}
SDL_Texture* FindTextureInCache(renderer* Renderer, void* Data)
{
	SDL_Texture* Found = 0;
	for(u32 DataIndex = 0;
			(!Found) && (DataIndex < Renderer->CacheCount);
			++DataIndex)
	{
		void* CachedData = Renderer->CachedData[DataIndex];
		if(CachedData == Data)
		{
			Found = Renderer->CachedTextures[DataIndex];
		}
	}

	return(Found);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The PushRenderCache which inserts a bitmap / texture pair in the cache is also very simple and I am not showing it here.

With that system, now the bitmap rendering have good performance and results !

# Testing the API

Now, with the bitmap rendering done, I felt that the engine was beginning to somewhat come together as a whole. I wanted to give it a test. So I just tried to implement a very simple Pong game, reusing as many component from the prototype code. I was able to do so in a little bit more than 2 hours. These two hours were extremely helpful to see the little holes that were left in the engine.
My take here is that, if you design a system, even using a *write-the-usage-code-first* methodology, you ought to test it to see how good you can perform as a user.

# Conclusion

Yay ! Obviously the engine is nowhere close to be feature-complete, but I still feel like all the basics are here.

Next up is probably gameplay. I have been saying that for a few weeks now and I kind of dread gameplay since I am still unsure about I want done in that sense, so we will see.

But for now, let's get to programming.

[^1]: I found out about an unofficial SDL lib called [SDL_gfx.h](http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/) which does basically what I wanted but I did not wished to add another dependency to the project.
[^2]: I am pretty sure I can do better than binding SDL_Texture and void pointers to identify a bitmap, like a bitmap ID, to get something more robust. But I did not go for that at first and since it works fine for now, I am keeping this system, but I am likely to revise it later.
