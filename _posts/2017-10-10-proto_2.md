Welcome to *The Road to a Protoype*, a blog series in which I weekly describe my attemp at prototyping a small game all by myself.

# Previously in...

So that was where we were at last week:

<center>A map with a few discovered points.</center>

I had a basic map with a player moving on edges and what looks like a simple UI. There was also a very basic mechanics of events where you could get hurt. And that was it. From there, the goal was to expand on it and explore the mechanics further.

# World generation

Since the basic idea of the prototype involved a few roguelike mechanics, the underlying mechanics could only be explored in they took place in a large world. Or at least a world larger than what I previously had. So that was what I tried to focus on this week.

I do not know much about world generation and I did not want to lose a lot of time learning about it right now. Once again, these steps are not to produce a final polished version of the world generator, but just to give me, in the least amount of work required, the most basic world generator I can work with. The basic requirements I had in mind were :

* The map should have a large amount of nodes.
* The connectivity between those nodes should be significant enough so that I can move freely, but not to the extent where I can abuse the moving system.
* The nodes should be grouped by zones (e.g. there could be a desert zone, or a forest zone).

My previous attempt at world gen had only the second requirement available but lacked the first and third ones.

Since I did not know about procedural generation much, I first went, as always, for the simplest thing : generate a fixed amount of nodes on the screen and place them uniformely at random on the map. For the edge connectivity, I used the following scheme: each node is linked to the three closest nodes that come after them in the node list. This allow the edges to be located quite properly even though this does not guaranteed that the final graph map is connected (which means that there could very well be nodes that are unreachable). In practice, this is not perfect, but will do for now. This is the very basic result of this methods:

Ok... well this is not really a very good map now, is it ? The random scheme is not really useful for building a map that gather all my requirements. But this was expected, because a simple noise will not do. In order to build something valuable, you need to put structure in things.

# Divide and conquer !

Since I knew that I wanted my world to be divided into zones, I just wondered how to organize those zones into something that had a real map structure.
I just arbitrarily decided that a zone would only be a rectangle on the screen which have a specified amount of nodes in them. For example, the forest zone would be down-left of the screen and have around twenty zones in it. Each zone would be responsible for its node generation. I was quite happy with this idea and felt like it embodied well the idea I had for the game.

So I did that, reusing the uniformely random node generator, but doing this in each zone with a different amount of node in each zone.

<center>Now with zones.</center>

Well... you cannot differentiate much, can you ? It is mostly because each zone uses the same world gen scheme as before. Since I want a structure, I knew that, in my map, there would be a basic zone which would be called the road and would go from left to right without changing much. With the zone structure layed out, I could easily change how one zone would generate its node. So I just needed to space the nodes in the Road Zone as I wished, display the zones for a clearer debug view, and I would get the following:

![Map 203](/images/proto_road/road_sc_203.png)
<center>Road Zone has its own world gen and zone rectangles are displayed.</center>

Well, this already looks a little bit better. But we can still improve on it.

# Why stop there ?

Indeed, why ? It now appeared that the uniform random generation was a very bad idea after all. Since it is not yet a final world gen system, I could just decide, for each zone, to place each node on a regular grid (and add a small random displacement to its position to make it look less boring). I would be then sure that the spacing is alright, the edges would not be lacking too much and the overall zone structure would be preserve. I just did that, added the zone name in the display and got the final result:

![Map 204](/images/proto_road/road_sc_204.png)
<center>Grid placement all the way!</center>

# Where to go from there ?

This is not the most perfect world gen algorithm, but it qualifies for all requirements I had for it. With that basic system in place, I can now spend more time thinking about game mechanics. This is clearly what I am going to work on next week. This will likely involve inventory and, more importantly, events that happens in the world each time you discover a node.

Let's get to programming.
