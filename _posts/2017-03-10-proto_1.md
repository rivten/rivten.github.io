# What is this about ?

I have regularly few ideas for games that could be somewhat cool, but most of them do not get me very excited about implementing them. I just write them down on my notebook and get on with it.

Yet, recently I had one that I found pretty interesting. At least it excited my mind and wrote down several ideas around the concept. In the end, I did not have by any means a real game or something even close to it. But I have something to begin with, not just a basic idea. That was it. I could start prototyping.

With this series of articles, I would like to regularly go through what has been done towards this very goal. The project might come to an end at some point, but I think it would be a good exercice to make a clear, short report of last week's or month's work. Let's hope it will be entertaining. Because here we go.

# Basic ideas around the game.

FTL : Faster than Light might be one of my favorite games of all time. It ranks easily in the top 3 at the very least. If you have not played it yet, you should definitively check it out. It is a roguelike where you play as the captain of a ship sent on a mission to destroy the rebellion, and it super addictive, rewarding and clever. What I always found fascinating about FTL is that the whole game is about choices. In this situation, should I spent my money by repairing or by buying this awesome weapon ? In another, should I improve my shields or my cloaking ? Choices. The game ends after you go through each of the eight sectors, one sector is a set of connected stars you can jump from and to. Choices again.

Anyway, I wanted to play with that idea of choices. The main idea was : you have a starting point and a place you are trying to reach. Between those two points, there is the Road. Big, broad, but maybe not so safe at times, and certainly always in the open. Apart from the road, ... well that is unknown. Forests, hidden castles, treacherous ruins and caves, powerful beasts and maybe rare weapons. But that route might end up taking longer that the Road, and you are in a hurry. Which path do you follow ?

There is more to that idea but I do not want to develop on things that are not settled. Prototyping will likely change a lot of stuff as things progress. Here is still the core of it.

# Where to start ?

I have never done a lot of prototyping, so my basic idea of it was : iterate as much and as fast as possible. Do not do something that does not directly contribute to the project and do not care about things you should not care about yet.

With that in mind, it seemed that I had two options about where to start.  I could start with an engine where most feature are already available. Since I had some experience with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) that could be a way.

I could also start a little bit lower than that and use SDL as a basic framework to have the fundamentals primitives of game development. I ended up chosing SDL2 because have used it extensively in the past and am quite familiar with it. Moreover it can be extended with other SDL libraries for fonts, audio or networking even. Finally, I did not enjoyed the idea of coding in Godot Script and wanted to go directly C++ even if it meant a little more fussing that I completly overcome.

# Prototyping !

After having picked your sharper tools, I only had to get the programming going. My basic mindset for this first week was : just go for it, do not think much, run.

The very first thing was obviously to get a window up on the screen. With SDL, it is just the easiest thing in the world and there is also a renderer available for free -- even though I do not find it very efficient; using OpenGL or an improved SIMD renderer might be worth doing if the project becomes more mature. Since I do not have much debug infrastructure yet, but still need to inspect some stuff even from the beginning, I used a trick I saw [Shawn McGrath](https://twitter.com/sssmcgrath) used on his stream which is to put as much information available in the window title. For example, FPS, mouse position or mouse button states. This is something very easy to do and incredibly helpful since you do not need to constatly break into your debugger and switch between windows to inspect data.

SDL renderer provides basic primitives to draw rectangles and lines. It is way too early to even think about using bitmap. With those primitives I was able to implement and render a basic graph structure. Ideally, for a real game, you would like the graph to be in a world space you have define, and then convert those coordinates to window space before rendering it. But since it seemed that I could end up losing a lot of time building an efficient world space system, I just wrote everything so that it could work in window space. This is not at all flexible and is something that will soon need fixes but very quick to implement. So I had a basic graph on the screen.

Now I needed to get user input. Not very hard. And within a few lines of code, I could get a character running from nodes. The moving function is again very poorly implemented : to check if a move is allowed, I check *all* edges in the graph to see if the move we want to make is in there. But since the graph is very small for now, this is not a concern at all. Then, just add a little bit of randomness to the graph nodes positions, some life points and here you go: a character moving on a *procedurally generated map*.

This is very basic but already helpful to test basic mechanics. Indeed, from now I could begin to implement gameplay stuff. There were two things that I judge important at first. A. There needed to be random events at some nodes of the graph. B. There needed to be important places you could encounter during your *run*. So with this first prototype structure, I build a very simple system that added at some nodes a random event (for now, the event could be either you gain or lose a life point) and some random points of interest. When you get to a point of interest, the node is considered discovered and the name of the point appears on the screen. Thanks to SDL, font rendering was not a hard thing to do but it is something very pretty to look at and might need some work in the future if things get serious. I just created a few names randomly and inserted them at random into the map, and here I got a basic prototype where you could explore a map, lose and gain life points and discover places. You can die or reach the end. You can encounter stuff or go through unharmed.

# Where to go from there ?

I was quite surprised by the fact that, even with using a *low-level* library such as SDL, I could get a small prototype up and running within a few days. This is surely not something big but something solid that can be improved and iterated upon without much effort.

Now, I feel like I need to test some ideas further. For example, we could give our hero some weapons and make him fight against monsters each time he encouters one. I would also like to make the map way bigger since for now it feels very artificial, this would need tackle the window space issue I was talking about previously though.

Anyway, let's get to programming.
