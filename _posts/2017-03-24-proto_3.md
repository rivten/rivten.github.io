Welcome to *The Road to a Protoype*, a blog series in which I weekly describe my attempt at prototyping a small game all by myself.

# Previously in...

Last week, I made the world map more consistent by giving it some structure. That structure was not perfect but allowed me to have a solid base to work on. Indeed, now the world map is divided into zones and each zone has its own set of special node. For now, these nodes can only be discovered and have a named attached to it. It is time for some dramatic events to take place.

# A simple design at first

My most important requirement for this week was to have a various set of events happening in each special node. For example, those are the sort of things that could happen in a run :

1. The hero meets someone who give him a weapon.
2. The hero takes $n$ damage.
3. If the hero has a certain item, then something happen. Otherwise something else.

And so on. 

The third example was interesting to me because it assumed that events could happen *only under specific conditions*. If and only if these conditions are gathered, then the event happen at the node.

With it, I had therefore had a basic event design at hand. I could decide that, for each zone in the world map, there would be two events. One good and one bad. They would be described according to the previous explanation.
This is by no mean a final event design, but it gives a *very* basic risk / reward factor to the system, for example: you can decide to look for the Bridge because you know there is a powerful item there, but on your way, you could meet the terrible army that will likely kill you if you do not have a powerful spell. It is then your own choice to go for it or not.

This simplistic system might even prove worthy since it is likely to be easy to expand on it. Indeed, having a more complete event system might mostly mean having more alternative events at a specific node.

# Event system requirements

Since it is still a very early prototype, I did not intented to have something even close to a robust event system. Yet, because of what I said earlier, I knew what my requirements were.

1. An event has a condition stating if the event should happen or not.
2. An event has an action that triggers if the condition is satisfied.
3. An event has a text that is displayed on the screen when the action triggers.
4. There can be multiple events at a given node, each one triggers under certain circumstances.

As I said many times before, the first thing that I wanted to do was the dumbest thing possible. So, how to write that system from the ground up ?

Well what happened first was that I wrote a piece of code that would check, each time the player made a move, what the new node was and react accordingly. For example, it would look like:

{% highlight c++ %}
site_type SiteType = DestMarker->Site.Type;
switch(SiteType)
{
	// [...]
	case SiteType_Bridge:
		{
			if((!IsInInventory(Player, WeaponType_Bow)) ||
			   (!IsInInventory(Player, BookType_Power)))
			{
				TakeDamage(Player, 1);
			}
		} break;
	case SiteType_EnemyCamp:
		{
			ForceWeapon(Player, WeaponType_Dagger);
		} break;
	// [...]
}
{% endhighlight %}

This felt okay... for a while. The move function in which this piece of code was happening was becoming quite big because of the amount of case deployed. And it did not seem flexible by a cent. Finally, the text that is displayed when the event is triggered is disconnected from the conditional part of the event. 

I think disconnected data is bad.

Even though that first system was a minimum viable system (because it did the basic requirements I expected out of him), I rewrote the whole thing. If the event system was to become something big (and I knew it was likely to be based on the idea for the game that I had), I had to approach the problem the right way.

# The usage code first

I found that [Casey Muratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori) from [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) as a wise saying for this situation:

> Always write the usage code first.

This rule and the whole programming philosophy that goes with it is partially explained in [this article](https://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0029.html#Usage), but I will quickly sum up that is at stake here.

The event system I want to write has to part:

1. The part where I do operations on the system. Things like: get the current state of the event, play the event, and so on. In this part, I do not care how the event system is implemented, I just want to use it.
2. The part where the system is implemented. How it is structured, what elementary operation it does, which function are available.

Casey's rule just tells us to begin by writing the first part, the *usage code* without knowing yet how things are structured in the back, this will get written afterwards. The great thing about that rule is that it makes great API that are pleasant to use, *because they were exactly designed that way*.

Now, back to my event system. I knew I wanted to get rid of the big switch case in the move function. Without knowing exactly how to replace it, I just wrote what seems logical to happen at that place.

{% highlight c++ %}
void Move(player* Player, u32 DestIndex, game_state* GameState)
{
		// [...]: Things to check if the move is correct.

		// NOTE(hugo): Event system part.
		scenario* Scenario = GetValidScenario(GameState, 
						DestMarker->Site);
		if(Scenario)
		{
			PlayScenario(GameState, Scenario);
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

And that was it. It is simple, way smaller that the first code and even pleasant to use. The Event / Scenario system is in charge of giving us back something we can play with, it is surely not in the Move function that we have to worry about doing a big switch statement.

Now that we know how we want things to behave, let's make the thing. Once again, I just aimed for the simplest thing. Looking back at my requirements, I wrote the following:

{% highlight c++ %}
#define SCENARIO_IS_VALID(name) bool name(game_state* GameState)
typedef SCENARIO_IS_VALID(scenario_is_valid);

#define SCENARIO_PLAY(name) bool name(game_state* GameState)
typedef SCENARIO_PLAY(scenario_play);

struct scenario
{
	char Text[256];
	scenario_is_valid* IsValid;
	scenario_play* Play;
};
{% endhighlight %}

This stems from the first three requirements of our event system. For the fourth one, I just added the fact that a node can have a list of scenario. Getting the valid scenario is just easy after that:

{% highlight c++ %}
scenario* GetValidScenario(game_state* GameState, site Site)
{
	scenario* ScenarioFound = 0;
	if(Site.Type != SiteType_None)
	{
		for(u32 ScenarioIndex = 0; 
		   (!ScenarioFound) && (ScenarioIndex < Site.ScenarioCount); 
		   ++ScenarioIndex)
		{
			scenario* CurrentScenario = Site.Scenarios + ScenarioIndex;
			if(CurrentScenario->IsValid(GameState))
			{
				ScenarioFound = CurrentScenario;
			}
		}
		Assert(ScenarioFound);
	}

	return(ScenarioFound);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing fancy here, we just give back the first valid scenario we encounter. And you got it, the basic scenario API.

In the end, I am quite happy with it because it ended up looking nice (even though I have yet to use it extensively) and did not take me a long time to make. Yet, it has some flaws and is definitevly improvable, but for now I think it will do.

I did not really focus about how it looks in game, so I just display the text on a blank rect for now. It is basic but work enough:

![Map 301](/images/proto_road/road_sc_301.png)
<center>Scenario text basic display</center>

# Where to go from there ?

With a good scenario system in our hand, I think it is time to make our prototype look like a real game. There are still important stuff missing:

1. A good inventory system
2. Fights
3. Bigger map

I think I thank to focus on having a waaaaay bigger map right now. I have to think about it though because it might be a big commitment so early on but the map is the thing I seem to have a clear idea on (compared to the other two). Anyway, going small steps at a time, I am not worried.

Let's get to programming.
